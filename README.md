# FilingLens

Citation-verified Q&A over SEC 10-K filings. Ask a question about the annual reports of about 12 public companies. Every sentence in the answer cites its source passage, sentences that can't be verified are flagged, and questions the filings can't answer are declined.

> **Under construction.** The live demo, eval results, and setup instructions will appear here as milestones land.

## Design decisions

- **Biome instead of ESLint + Prettier:** one dependency and one config handle both linting and formatting, and it runs much faster. It is set to Prettier's default output style.
- **Vite dev proxy instead of the Cloudflare Vite plugin:** `pnpm dev` runs `vite` and `wrangler dev` side by side, and Vite forwards `/api` to the Worker. This keeps a single deploy path (`wrangler deploy` in `worker/` serving `web/dist`). The plugin would replace the build output and deploy config with its own layout.
